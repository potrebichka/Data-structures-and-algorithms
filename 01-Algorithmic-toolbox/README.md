## 3-2. Maximum value of the loot.
#### Implement algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem.
**Input:** The first line of the input contains the number n of items and the capacity W of 
a knapsack. The next n lines define the values and weights of the items. The i-th line 
contains integers vi and wi â€” the value and the weight of i-th item, respectively.
**Output:** The maximal value of fractions of items that fit into the knapsack.

## 3-3. Maximum advertisement revenue.
####. Given two sequences a1,a2...an (ai is the profit per click of the i-th ad) and b1,b2..bn 
(bi is the average number of clicks per day of the i-th slot), we need to partition them into 
n pairs (ai,bj) such that the sum of their product is maximized.
**Input:** The first line contains an integer n, the second one contains a sequence of 
integers a1,a2...an, the third one contains a sequence of integers b1,b2...bn.
**Output:** The maximum value of $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i*c_i$
