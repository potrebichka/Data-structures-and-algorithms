## 1-1. Finding an Exit from a Maze.
*Given an undirected graph and two distinct vertices u and v, check if there is an path between u and v.*

**Input:** An undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. The next line contains two vertices u and v of the graph.

**Output:** 1 if there is a path between u and v and 0 otherwise.

## 1-2. Adding Exits to a Maze.
*Given an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges, compute the number of connected components in it.*

**Input:** An undirected graph with n vertices and m edges.

**Output:** The number of connected components.

## 2-1. Checking Consistency of CS Curriculum.
*Check whether a given directed graph with n vertices and m edges contains a cycle.*

**Input:** A directed graph with n vertices and m edges.

**Output:** 1 if the graph contains a cycle and 0 otherwise.

##2-2. Determining an Order of Courses.
*Compute a topological ordering of a given directed acyclic graph (DAG) with n vertices and m edges.*

**Input:** A graph

**Output:** Any topological ordering of its vertices.

##2-3. Checking Whether Any Intersection in a City is Reachable from Any Other.
