## 1-1. Finding an Exit from a Maze.
*Given an undirected graph and two distinct vertices u and v, check if there is an path between u and v.*

**Input:** An undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. The next line contains two vertices u and v of the graph.

**Output:** 1 if there is a path between u and v and 0 otherwise.

## 1-2. Adding Exits to a Maze.
*Given an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges, compute the number of connected components in it.*

**Input:** An undirected graph with n vertices and m edges.

**Output:** The number of connected components.
